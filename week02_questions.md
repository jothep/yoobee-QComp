Q1: Why can't I divide by zero?
A:Because “dividing by b” means “multiplying by the inverse of b,” and 0 has no multiplicative inverse. 
By definition, a/b is the number q such that b*q=a. If b=0 and a!=0, we would need a q with 0*q=a; but 0*q=0 for every q, which cannot equal a!=0. Therefore, there is no solution.
If b=0 and a=0: we seek $q$ such that 0*q=0. This holds for every q, so there are infinitely many solutions and the result is not unique.

Q2:Study the electrical frequencies of different countries and understand and explain the reasons behind the frequency differences.
50 Hz: All of Europe, most of Africa, India and most of Asia, Mainland China, Australia/New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, etc.
60 Hz: Almost all of the Americas (United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, etc.), South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, etc.
Because of the infrastructure involved, once a frequency is determined to be used, it is difficult to change it.
